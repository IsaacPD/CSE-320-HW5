Welcome :)
To run the application with only the emulated memory and no cache (part 1) just run
$ ./main 
in one terminal and
$ ./mem
in another in that order

To run the application with the cache (part 2) run
$ ./main part2
in one terminal and then
$ ./mem
$ ./cache
in their own respective terminals in that order

./main supports the following commands
create - creates a process and prints out the resulting id of the process
list - lists all the processes "running" with their ids
mem PROCESS - lists the virtual memory addresses used by PROCESS (decimal integer)
allocate PROCESS - allocates a virtual address to PROCESS
write PROCESS VIRTUAL VALUE - Writes VALUE (decimal integer) to VIRTUAL (binary integer >= 0) address of PROCESS (decimal integer)
kill PROCESS - Kills PROCESS and releases associated memory
exit - Exits ./main and all associated memory it is using
